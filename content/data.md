# Data

## Try our Open Linked Data Fragments server
We offer an open Basic Linked Data Fragments server
at [http://data.linkeddatafragments.org/](http://data.linkeddatafragments.org/).

The reason we can offer such a public Basic LDF server
**without fear for availability issues**
is that [server resource usage is minimal](/concept/).
With a public SPARQL endpoint, we would need aÂ much stronger infrastructure
to offer the same data in a queryable way.

This server hosts various datasets, including
[DBpedia](http://data.linkeddatafragments.org/dbpedia)
and
[Wiktionary](http://data.linkeddatafragments.org/wiktionary).
<br>
You can execute queries on these datasets with a [Linked Data Fragments client](/software/).

## Host your own Linked Data Fragments server
You can easily deploy your own server
on top of an existing SPARQL endpoint.
[Download the server](/downloads/).
Because this server only executes simple queries on your endpoint,
there are no scalability issues.
