# Motivation

## Towards Web-scale querying of Linked Data
To unlock the full potential of Linked Data sources,
we need flexible ways to query them.
<br>
Public SPARQL endpoints aim to fulfill that need,
but their availability is [notoriously problematic](http://sw.deri.org/~aidanh/docs/epmonitorISWC.pdf).

By offering datasets as [basic Linked Data Fragments](/concept/),
we can vastly improve the scalability of servers,
while still allowing clients to query ther data efficiently.
