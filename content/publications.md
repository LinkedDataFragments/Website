## [Web-Scale Querying through Linked Data Fragments](/publications/ldow2014.pdf)
by Ruben Verborgh, Miel Vander Sande, Pieter Colpaert, Sam Coppens, Erik Mannens, and Rik Van de Walle

To unlock the full potential of Linked Data sources, we need flexible ways to query them. Public SPARQL endpoints aim to fulfill that need, but their availability is notoriously problematic. We therefore introduce Linked Data Fragments, a publishing method that allows efficient offloading of query execution from servers to clients through a lightweight partitioning strategy. It enables servers to maintain availability rates as high as any regular HTTP server, allowing querying to scale reliably to much larger numbers of clients. This paper explains the core concepts behind Linked Data Fragments and experimentally verifies their Web-level scalability, at the cost of increased query times. We show how trading server-side query execution for inexpensive data resources with relevant affordances enables a new generation of intelligent clients.
