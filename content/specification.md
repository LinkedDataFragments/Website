## Specification by the Hydra W3C Community Group
The Linked Data Fragments specification is developed
as part of the [Hydra W3C Community Group](http://www.hydra-cg.com/).

The Hydra project provides technologies for the design of smart APIs and smart clients.
It consists of the [Hydra Core Vocabulary](http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/),
which contains the essential building blocks for machine-accessible hypermedia APIs,
and [Linked Data Fragments](linked-data-fragments/),
which focus on APIs and clients that enable Web-scale publishing and querying.
